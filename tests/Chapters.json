      "Description": "The <a href='https://github.com/HandsOnDataViz/leaflet-storymaps-with-google-sheets' target='_blank'>Leaflet Storymaps code template</a> is designed to guide readers along a point-by-point tour, with a scrolling narrative to display text, images, audio, video, and scanned map backgrounds. Readers can follow the scrolling narrative or click on any marker to go directly to a specific chapter. You can create your own version by entering your map data into a linked Google Sheet (or CSV file) and uploading it into a free GitHub repository to host online.
